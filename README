Graph/Clique version 0.01
=========================
Graph::Clique module 

This module extends Greg Bacon's implementation on clique reduction with regular expression.
Originally can be found at: L<http://home.hiwaay.net/~gbacon/perl/clique.html>

The function take clique size (k) and vertices (list of lists) and return all the vertices
that form the clique. 

K-clique problem is known to be NP-complete, so it is advisable to limit the number
of edges according to your predefined threshold, rather than exhaustively searching them.

Using Graph::Clique
===================

my @cliques = getcliques($k,\@edges);
# @edges is list of list of the edges and $k is the clique size.
